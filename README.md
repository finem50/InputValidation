Description:
Your main program will contain a loop. On each pass through the loop, you will request, accept, and validate the following input and print either the specified output for correct input or a message indicating the input was invalid. At the bottom of the loop, you will ask the user if he/she wishes to make another pass through the loop and either repeat for ‘y’ or ‘Y’ or not.

For all input:
Follow the expectations for ensuring clean input. Each input line must contain only one data item. Input lines must never be allowed to be arbitrarily long. In addition to making the current input invalid, any data left on the current input line must be thrown away before you request and accept the next input.

The inputs and corresponding outputs:
Request and accept the numerator and denominator of a proper fraction (that means it must have an absolute value of less than 1). You will ask for the numerator and the denominator separately. Values must be integers. They may be negative. If the input is valid, you will output the ratio as a decimal (eg. 0.75 for 3 and 4).
Request and accept a valid 4.0 GPA value (so this must a floating point number in the range 0.0-4.0 with no more than 3 digits after the decimal point). You will just print the value with a label in the case of a valid value.

The next two use the following table:
Integer
Color
2
Blue
3
Crimson
7
 
Gold
 
12
Lime
20
 
Tan
 Based on the table, request and accept an integer and print the corresponding color name. Anything other than an integer from the integer column is invalid.
Based on the table, request and accept a color name and print the corresponding integer. Anything other than a color name from the table is invalid.
Request and accept a string of up to 32 characters. It may contain whitespace. It must not contain more than 32 characters. For valid strings, output the length of the string followed by the string itself.
